## Introduction 
This is an implementation of a text classification model using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings, developed in Python. The model uses a deep neural network to classify text into a set of predefined categories based on the meanings of the words in the text.

## Glove Embeddings

GloVe Embeddings
The implementation uses pre-trained GloVe word embeddings that were trained on a large corpus of text. Here is the main idea behind the GloVe word embedding: ![Alt text](glove.png)
