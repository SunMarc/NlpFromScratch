# Implementing Skip-gram Model with negative sampling as a Matrix Factorization Problem
In this project, we will be implementing the Skip-gram model as a matrix factorization problem using Python and Pytorch.
The Skipgram model is a popular neural network architecture used for natural language processing tasks such as word embedding. 
In this approach, we treat the Skipgram model as a matrix factorization problem, where we factorize a word-context matrix to obtain the word and context embeddings.
